Our application will be accessible at the docker.dev domain. 
You should map this domain to your Docker host IP address. 

If you run Docker natively on your Linux operating system, use the IP address of your own computer. 
Or add to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 docker.dev

If you rely on Boot2Docker, find your Docker host IP address with the boot2docker ip bash command. 
Let's assume your Docker host IP address is 192.168.59.103. 
You can map the docker.dev domain name to the 192.168.59.103 IP address by appending this line 
to your local computer's /etc/hosts file:

192.168.59.103 docker.dev
