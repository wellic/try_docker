Install Docker

Docker requires Linux, and it supports many different Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, CRUX, Fedora, Gentoo, RedHat, and SUSE. Take your pick. Your local Linux operating system is the Docker host on which you instantiate and run Docker containers.

Many of us run Mac OS X or Windows, but we're not out of luck. There is something called Boot2Docker. This is a tool that creates a tiny Linux virtual machine, and this virtual machine becomes the Docker host instead of our local operating system. Don't worry, this virtual machine is really small and boots in about 5 seconds.

After you install Boot2Docker, you can either double-click the Boot2Docker application icon, or you can execute these bash commands in a terminal session:

boot2docker init
boot2docker up
eval "$(boot2docker shellinit)"

These three commands create the virtual machine (if it is not already created), start the virtual machine, and export the necessary environment variables so that your local operating system can communicate with the Docker host virtual machine.

If you're like me and dislike typing more than necessary, you can create a bash alias. Add this line to your ~/.bash_profile file:

alias du="boot2docker init && boot2docker up && eval \"\$(boot2docker shellinit)\""


This creates a bash alias named du (an abbreviation for the completely arbitrary phrase Docker Up). Now you can simply type du in a new terminal session to create, start, and initialize your Docker host virtual machine.
